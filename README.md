# European Energy Consumption Report

In this notebook, we are investigating the consumption of different types of renewable energies in the European Union.
This is a personal project which exemplifies the common data visualization workflow: we are starting from a "dirty" dataset, downloaded from Eurostat in a .tsv format,
cleaning it and preparing it mainly using pandas. We are then analyzing the dataset and using different types of visualizations (using mainly matplotlib, seaborn and pandas) to gather insight from the data. We are finally commenting our results and highlighting interesting aspects which will emerge from the dataset.
